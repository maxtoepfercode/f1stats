# This Repository is named F1-template

It handles data from a db that is connected via Heroku. This data is containing times, names and variables. The 
website accesses the database and compares 2 Drivers and displayes their relevant information that is associated with this event.
It also displays news which are linked with their origin. A register and login function will soon be added.

I am currently working on building a function that displays the picture of the driver selected in the Dropdown menu as the background.
I am also planning to add more SQL statements into my code so that you could set parameters as the user accessing the website.

If you have any questions concerning my code reach out to me!
